The most basic vector operations we want our Point object to handle are addition and subtraction. For two points (𝑥1,𝑦1)+(𝑥2,𝑦2)=(𝑥1+𝑥2,𝑦1+𝑦2)

and similarly for subtraction. Implement a method within Point that allows two Point objects to be added together using the + operator, and likewise for subtraction. Once this is done, execute the grader.score cell for this question (do not edit that cell; you only need to modify the Point class.)

(Remember that __add__ and __sub__ methods will allow us to use the + and - operators.)

class Point(object):

​

    def __init__(self, x, y):

        self.x = x

        self.y = y

    

    def __add__(self, other):

        return Point(self.x + other.x,

                     self.y + other.y)

    

    def __sub__(self, other):

        return Point(self.x - other.x,

                     self.y - other.y)

    

    def __repr__(self):

        return f'Point({self.x}, { self.y})'

Point(0,1) - Point(1,0)

Point(-1, 1)

from functools import reduce

def add_sub_results(points):

    points = [Point(*point) for point in points]

    return [str(reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, points)), 

            str(reduce(lambda x, y: x - y, points))]
