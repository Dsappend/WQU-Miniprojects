For a given Mersenne number with exponent 𝑝, the number is prime if the Lucas-Lehmer series is 0 at position 𝑝−2. Write a function that tests if a Mersenne number with exponent 𝑝 is prime. Test if the Mersenne numbers with prime 𝑝

between 3 and 65 (i.e. 3, 5, 7, ..., 61) are prime. Your final answer should be a list of tuples consisting of (Mersenne exponent, 0) (or 1) for each Mersenne number you test, where 0 and 1 are replacements for False and True respectively.

HINT: The zip function is useful for combining two lists into a list of tuples

def ll_prime(p):

    if lucas_lehmer(p)[-1] == 0:

        return (p, 1)

    return (p, 0)

        

primes = get_primes(3,65)

​

mersenne_primes = [ll_prime(p) for p in primes]
