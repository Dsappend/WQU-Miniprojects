We can test if a Mersenne number is prime using the Lucas-Lehmer test. First let's write a function that generates the sequence used in the test. Given a Mersenne number with exponent 𝑝

, the sequence can be defined as

𝑛0=4
𝑛𝑖=(𝑛2𝑖−1−2)𝑚𝑜𝑑(2𝑝−1)

Write a function that accepts the exponent 𝑝
of a Mersenne number and returns the Lucas-Lehmer sequence up to 𝑖=𝑝−2 (inclusive). Remember that the modulo operation is implemented in Python as %.

def lucas_lehmer(p):

    ll = [4]

    for i in range(1,p-1):

        ll.append(

            (ll[i-1]**2-2) % (2**p-1)

        )

    return ll

Use your function to calculate the Lucas-Lehmer series for 𝑝=17 and pass the result to the grader.

ll_result = lucas_lehmer(17)
